# Code for "An Extension on "Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets" for all Pairwise Comparisons"

The authors of the paper "An Extension on "Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets" for all Pairwise Comparisons", helpfully released an implementation available at http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/multipleTest.zip. In case that source goes down, I thought I'd push the code here as well for safekeeping and easier access.
